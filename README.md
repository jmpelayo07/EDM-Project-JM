## About Me
Hi I my name is John Miko F. Pelayo, a first-year BSIS student at City College of Angeles. Coding is something I’m really passionate about, and I love experimenting with different programming languages to improve my skills. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably catch me playing mobile games, keeping up with the latest news, or just enjoying the whole gaming experience.
